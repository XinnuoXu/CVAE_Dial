susan polgar lives and works in new york city . she sees the world in a very unusual way . susan is the first female chess grandmaster . but she wasn ' t born with her brilliant brain . it was created by an extraordinary childhood . playing black , paul truong , a former us champion at a supercharged form of chess . blitz . each player must play the entire game in just sixty seconds . it ' s a high speed demonstration of chess playing genius . you ' re in total control of your own destiny . here it ' s your brain versus the opponent ' s . by understanding susan ' s brilliant brain , we can unlock the potential of our own . we can understand how people make life or death decisions , faster than a super - computer . or perform miracles of memory in their every day jobs . and how in the battle of the sexes , the female brain can out - manoeuvre the male . i really believe that if you put your mind to it , and you really want it , you can achieve it , whatever it is . susan ' s brain is an unstoppable force . and her opponent has run out of time . the latest in a long line of distinguished victims . susan has competed on equal terms with the greatest names in chess , like garry kasparov , anatoly karpov , and even the great bobby fischer . but susan ' s genius is no accident of birth . she was once an ordinary four year old , whose life was transformed by a unique education . susan polgar grew up a world away from new york city . in the late 1960s , hungary still languished in the iron grip of the soviet union . for the ordinary citizens of budapest , daily life was a grim struggle to make ends meet . the future queen of the chessboard was hardly born a princess . that is the street i was born in , where i used to live for the first ten years of my life . the closest side that you see was my room , and that ' s where i first learned to play chess . and then a second room was where my parents were sleeping and was kind of a living room . it brings back a lot of memories . if susan ' s home was ever so humble , her father was a man with a unique vision . a trained psychologist , laszlo polgar had made a deep study of the childhood origins of genius . the archetypal example was wolfgang amadeus mozart . already composing at the age of five , he seemed to be the classic case of a child born with special gifts . when zsuzsa , or susan , was born in april 1969 , the polgar family experiment was underway . her father had already written a book called " bringing up genius " . and it said that genius was not born - but made . it reads here , a quote : which means : " a genius equals work and fortunate circumstances . " by ' fortunate circumstance ' , laszlo meant the happy home that he and his wife klara would provide . and the hard work would be guaranteed by schooling susan himself . my father believed that the potential of most children is not used optimally . he felt that there is not much i would get out of going to school daily . laszlo planned to train susan in mathematics , but she chose her own future by a happy accident . one day unexpectedly , in a search for a new toy , i opened a cabinet and a chess set fell out and i asked my mum what is it ? and she said : in the early 1970s , chess was totally dominated by men . some of the world ' s best players believed that the female brain just couldn ' t cope with the game . a little girl was about to prove them wrong . these are the gardens of blenheim palace in oxfordshire - home to one of the biggest hedge mazes in the world . this type of navigation problem is a well known battleground of the sexes . i went round that far side with the zig - zaggy bits , and then up here . i remember most of the turns that i have been through . the boys seem to be looking at the big picture . they have a strong memory of where they ' ve been , and where they need to go . i ' m just trying to keep going in that direction . or at least , they think they do . i ' m going to go right , no i ' m not , i ' m going left . oh , god ! why ? the human brain has two hemispheres , left and right . most of our thinking happens in a thin outer layer of each , called the cortex . but in males , the cortex is thicker in the right brain , which excels at spatial thinking . so boys are thought to use a highly spatial strategy . they create a mental image of the whole maze to use as a map . then they might use a reference point like the sun , to figure out where they are . and by rotating their mental maps , they can then decide which way to turn next . so girls also rely on the left brain , which excels at verbal reasoning , rather than the whole maze , they focus on features that they can describe in words , like the circular hedges . the girls ' navigate by following a list of directions , from landmark to landmark . but with no overall map of the maze , it ' s easy to lose sight of the landmarks - and get lost . well this is annoying ! in this kind of maze , scientists consistently find that boys come out ahead , by using their mental maps . yes ! i ' m there . in mazes with more prominent landmarks , it ' s the girls who would take the honours . but today , they have to settle for second place . found it ! in the early 1970s , it was taken for granted that chess also required a typically male way of thinking . like the maze problem , the game seems to depend on a spatial awareness of the board and all the pieces . but then susan polgar came along . when she was still just a tiny girl , her father planned to prove that gender differences in the brain were not important . i think that ' s the beauty of life that we don ' t all have to be a certain way to succeed , there can be many roads to rome , as they say . just a few months after she learned the game , laszlo took susan to voros meteor , the most formidable chess club in budapest . susan was about to face male opposition in more ways than one . i first came here , late 1973 or very early 1974 . and well , the place so far looks exactly as it did then . i walked in a room , it was full of smoke with elder men . them thinking that my father is looking for a game , and just brought me along . but the reality was my father wanted me to have a game to see how i ' ll do against the members of the club . the club members thought laszlo was mad . but if they were ready to humour a pretty little girl , they weren ' t ready for what happened next . susan began the habit of a lifetime - beating men at chess . i had a whole bunch of guys after losing to me , complaining . one said : oh i didn ' t sleep well . the next one : i was sick . the third one : i had a stomach ache , you know , it ' s like , was kind of going on in a series , and you know i jokingly said that i ' ve never beaten a healthy man . the only man who wasn ' t shocked was laszlo polgar . he was building susan ' s training around a mental skill that didn ' t depend on either the left or right brain . girls could master it just as easily as boys , and before long , susan was literally beating men with her eyes closed . susan ' s about to play a game of chess with a difference . okay , why don ' t you be white ? okay , e4 . e4 . c5 . knight to c3 . susan ' s friend ed has the chessboard in front of him , just like in a normal game . knight to c6 . but susan doesn ' t need it . she ' s playing the game in her head . the only board she needs is in her mind ' s eye . f5 . now you ' ve gotta be careful . amateur players like ed have to see the board , to keep track of all 32 chess men . i ' ll play g5 . but susan follows all the moves using her fundamental chess ability - memory . an ongoing task like a game of chess , is handled by a mental function known as ' working memory ' , at the very front of the brain . the relevant brain cells , or neurons , store any necessary information by forming a network of electrical connections . but these connections die away within seconds , so working memory is limited . it ' s like a temporary scratchpad , that can only store about seven items of information . but just how good is susan ' s working memory ? this is thompson street in new york , home of the city ' s sidewalk chess cafes . and we ' re about to give susan a memory test . can she memorise all the pieces and pawns on this diagram ? that ' s 28 items of information . to make things even trickier , the diagram has been pasted to the side of a cafe ' s speeding van . susan only has time for a single , three second glance . but watch this . susan ' s working memory is working overtime . she ' s made an exact copy . the diners at this london restaurant don ' t know it , but their table is under surveillance . he ' s proceeding here in a counter - clockwise order . and given that 1492 was when columbus discovered america , you don ' t have to keep track of the individual digits any longer , all the four digits will be retrieved as a symbol group from memory . susan handles the information on a chessboard in exactly the same way . she doesn ' t remember all the pieces individually - instead , she breaks everything down into chunks . the menacing formation of whites , queen and bishops is one chunk . the heavily protected black king is another . but without chunking , her memory is no better than anyone else ' s . and here ' s the proof . in the chess diagram on the other side of the van , the pieces have been placed at random by a non - chess player . so this time , there are no recognisable chunks . now susan ' s trying to remember 24 individual pieces - and she can ' t do it . all the pieces are in random position . it ' s jus so much harder to remember , especially under a very short time . but how does susan identify chess chunks ? to her they ' re lifelong friends . memories that were implanted in her brain during her extraordinary childhood . susan polgar ' s second childhood home was in this budapest tower block . we ' re almost there . the tiny family apartment was a production factory , where susan ' s brain was engineered for the game of chess . the current tenants have no idea that a genius formed her earliest memories within these walls . wow . still the same . my phone used to be here . when we finally got a phone for the first time we used to keep it there . wow , and this used to be the living room . this is where susan did some of the hardest work of her life , for up to six hours a day . i used to have a wall of chess books here , a library of chess books . a collection of four to 5,000 of different titles . and actually i even had a catalogue of chess games . this massive effort was required throughout susa ' s childhood to commit the complex secrets of chess to memory . the number of possible games is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the universe . but chess chunks are the order in the chaos . these small but typical formations appear again and again in different games . they are the basic words in the language of chess . most ten year olds know only 10,000 words . at the same age , susan was devoting her childhood to learning 100,000 chess chunks . this process would physically transform her brain . the memorised information is now hard - wired , and can last a lifetime . like anyone else , susan ' s long term memory is a storehouse of family faces and lifetime experiences . but now chess chunks were also indelibly imprinted on her brain . susan ' s two younger sisters , sofia and judith , were next on the genius assembly line . and within a few years , the family would be ready to take the world of chess by storm . at 15 , susan was already the top ranked female payer in the world . at the 1985 new york open , she caused a sensation by beating a grandmaster for the first time . by 1989 , 12 year old judith had a winning streak of eight competitions in a row . at 14 , sofia annihilated four grandmasters for one of the greatest tournament results of all time . just watching them seated at chessboards i immediately had a sense that i had never seen with women players elsewhere . susan is still a powerful presence at the board . like all the polgar sisters , she seems to make a move as easily as taking a breath . there seemed to be a line direct from their brain to the end of the finger and the piece moved and that was it . but it should be beyond the power of a human brain to pick the best move . there are roughly four billion possibilities for the next three moves alone . that ' s a calculation only a supercomputer could perform . so how can susan move at this incredible speed ? for hartston , the only explanation is that her human brain is using a very human skill . by training , william hartston is a psychologist and a former united kingdom chess champion . it ' s not as bad as i feared . but today , he ' s going back to square one - as a trainee fire fighter . hartston plans to compare his novice skills with those of expert fire fighter , leigh corke . if you want to take a quick look at the smoke that ' s coming out there at the moment . i ' m going into that ? you ' re going into there , yeah . they ' re up against a terrifying opponent . this is flashover - a major killer of fire fighters . my wife always said i ' d go to hell ! but even more important when you ' ve done it often enough , you know , you sense what the result of it is going to be and you ' re ready with the next move . intuition turns out to be a learned skill . it means trusting your experience - and the ability to recognise and react to familiar patterns . and surprising as it may seem , chess players rely more heavily on intuition than calculation . an amateur wastes precious time thinking through his possible moves . but a grandmaster can make the best move without thinking . susan is so good at it , that it ' s possible her brain has a dedicated pattern processor . with modern scanning techniques , it might even be possible to identify it . but there ' s a problem . the brain is so complex that to find and identify any specific structure is a daunting task . but scientists are sometimes given clues , telling them where to look for specific functions . and it happens when the brain goes wrong . oh thanks very much , and i ' ll read it through and i ' ll look for mistakes and then i ' ll take the proof back to the sub ' s desk and i ' ll think : well who was it who gave it to me ? i don ' t remember ! mary ann suffers from prosopagnosia , commonly known as face blindness . even finding a close colleague can be next to impossible . you ' re sort of tiptoeing round surreptitiously looking at everybody ' s screen to see if they ' ve got my column up on the screen . mary ann knows she ' s looking at a face - she jus doesn ' t recognise it as someone she knows . i wish i knew how people recognised other people because it would make it so much easier for me . but it ' s as hard for me to understand as it would be for a colour blind person to , you know , if somebody said to them well , can ' t you see the difference between red and green ? you know , that ' s red and that ' s green . as many as one in 50 people have some degree of face blindness . but mary ann was unaware of her condition for years , because she has learned to identify people in other ways . psychologist david wilkinson wants to know more . so what coping strategies do you use ? oh goodness . yeah , you seem very more keen to focus in on local detail , on parts of the face , and so you ' re using a different strategy . well that ' s what i use to compensate for the fact that i can ' t recognise the face . so i think , right , there must be some feature on the face that i can compare , to see which is alike . i mean i ' ve now worked out you ' ve got a bump here on your nose . so that would help me next time i see you maybe . but what mary ann doesn ' t know , is that one of these faces belongs to doctor david wilkinson , with whom she ' s just spent the whole afternoon . and with him is laura , a secretary from mary ann ' s office whom she sees every day . and even then , it was only when your face was right up against mine that i spotted your sort of , you know bobble on the nose . brain scans of people like mary ann have revealed damage to the specific structure that ' s responsible for face recognition . the so - called ' fusiform face area ' is at the back of the brain , where first processing of information from the eyes takes place . in a normal brain , it rapidly assesses any new face for its distinctive proportions of eyes , nose , and mouth . then it looks for a match among all the familiar faces stored in long term memory . the whole process is lightning fast . we can recognise people we have met before in approximately 100 milliseconds . it ' s about pattern recognition . she has come to meet professor joy hirsch of colombia university , a leading expert in brain imaging techniques . and one thing these two women can agree on , is that size doesn ' t matter . the female brain is quite a bit smaller than the male brain in general , and we know that there ' s no difference in our intelligence . absolutely ! i agree on that one ! inside the scanner , susan can see projected images of some of the world ' s most famous chess players . the fusiform face area , her brain ' s dedicated face processor , is powerfully activated . but does susan ' s brain have another processor that ' s dedicated to chess patterns ? she ' s now looking at diagrams from her own chess games - some dating back to her distant childhood in budapest . she ' s been asked to think about each diagram as if it ' s a game in progress , calculating her next move . these are the first scans of a world champion ' s brain playing chess . but a comparison with the face recognition scan leads to a remarkable discovery . we ' re looking at the bottom of the brain , four slices , and these two areas ; this is the fusiform face area . susan is using exactly the same area of her brain for both faces and chess . for you , we can ' t discriminate a face area from a chess area , they are identical . astonishingly , susan ' s brain has hijacked the fusiform face area and adapted it to chess . years of intense childhood training literally molded susan ' s brain for the game . it ' s solid evidence for her father ' s theory - that genius can be created . at the age of 21 , the quality and number of susan ' s victories against top opposition earned her the official title of grandmaster . the first woman among nearly 600 men . youngest sister judith quickly followed suit . ranked in the top fifteen male players , she is now a leading contender for the world title . but susan ' s attention is riveted on the tense deciding match for the seven year olds of the second grade . yash pershad battles for the title against susan ' s son , tommy . he ' s a fighter and he ' s used to playing long games . so i have my fingers crossed , and hoping things will end well . six year old leeam will be next in line . susan sands at a discreet distance , getting used to a new kind of tension - as a chess mum . i won ! i got first place . he played well until the end , and then he messed up a lot . he stepped into a one move checkmate , and now i ' m the us champion . the national champion who , with 6.5 points is tom polgar ! if they want to be grandmasters , tommy and leeam won ' t have to look too far for the best possible training . but they better be ready to work hard . tomorrow we ' ll go to disney and have lots of fun .
. we saw her first in antioch when titus was on duty there . we thought her so superb that titus paid for her to tour the provinces . and now , my dear friends , the entertainment is over . it was w = wonderful and a b - b - beautiful dinner . thank you , but i wasn ' t inviting a compliment . it ' s just that i have something to perform . and i ' ve brought you here , as our dearest friends , to be with me . what ' s this ? a surprise for me too ? yes , my dear , it is . she never tells me anything . very naughty to surprise our guests and not tell your husband . you know that i love you very much ? now i ' m really worried . this is going to cost a fortune ! how much have you spent ? . nothing . i ' ve spent nothing . you may remember that a weak ago tonight , we went to a dinner given by the emperor . of course . you may also remember that tiberius was fascinated by our daughter . i must admit , i saw him looking at camilla once or twice . what you don ' t know is that she received a summons to the palace the next day . what ? . a summons ? you never told me . i thought it best not to put you in a position where you would object . what is this , lollia ? what are you telling me ? a summons to the emperor is not something to be refused , but i wouldn ' t let my daughter go alone , knowing his reputation . so i went with her . we went into a room i imagine he keeps for such receptions . i ' d never bean into that room before , not met anyone who had . the walls were hung with what the emperor imagines is erotic art . they depict scenes of incredible beastliness - not fit for anyone to look at , let alone a young girl lollia , why are you telling me this now in front of all our friends ? these are not just friends . they are all . in their different ways , important people in rome . that ' s why they ' re here tonight . when i objected and said he should be ashamed of himself for trying to corrupt a young girl , he simply smiled and said , " what about an old one ? " no , titus , please . then he clapped his hands , and a slave appeared from another room carrying a tray of wine . the slave was naked . .. and while tiberius spoke to her , he stroked the slave . .. in his twisted way , he thought it might inflame camilla ' s passions . but camilla burst into tears and begged to be allowed to leave . he then pretended to be upset and complained she ' d given him a different impression at the dinner . he then turned to me and told me to go home . no more ! no , titus . no , enough . let me finish ! if i ' d had this with me then , i ' d have used it on him . instead , i begged a moment with him alone . he granted it . and there , i offered myself in my daughter ' s place . yes , titus , my husband . .. to save my daughter , i offered myself in her place . and he accepted . my dear , that was nothing for me to save her . i took her to the gate . .. and warned her not to say anything to anyone . .. and then returned . don ' t , lollia , please . .. i ' ve nearly finished . i said that to prostitute myself for my daughter was nothing . what wouldn ' t we do to save our children ? i should have gone to the gate . .. into the room , out again . .. no one would have bean the wiser . i did go into that room . i was there subjected to . .. acts of . .. such abominable filth . .. to bestial obscenities . .. with him and his slaves of both sexes . .. that mere prostitution seems like a blessed state compared to it . you must forget , lollia . you must put it from your mind . you have saved your husband and your daughter . no , agrippina , that is not possible ! if there ' d bean just one part of me befouled by his lust , i should have come home and cut it out ! with this knife ! but i can ' t live with the memory of what he did to me . nor can i get into my husband ' s bed again . nor have his arms around me . move aside for the emperor ! don ' t block the road . make way , there . stand aside . clear the road for the emperor ! make way ! well . well ! is it my son who greets his mother with such affectionate eagerness ? good day , mother . in a hurry , are you ? another treason trial ? . who is it today ? . there are no trials today . ran out of people to prosecute ? you ' ll have more time to spend with your mother . don ' t shout . i ' m not deaf . you ' ve bean deaf to me for years . why did you refuse the spanish permission to build a temple to me ? i will not discuss such matters in the street . good day . move on . it ' s my birthday next month ! what are you going to buy me ? i heard about lollia ! disgusting ! your brother drusus was worth ten of you ! thrasyllus ! where is that damned astrologer ? . coming , excellency , coming . cast my mother ' s horoscope . what for ? . i want to know how much longer i have to put up with her . do you know the time of her birth ? no . i can only do a rough calculation . why don ' t you ask her ? . it ' s her birthday soon . it could be a present . yes . she ' d like that . she admires you since you prophesied she ' d outlive her husband . i could see she had every intention of doing so . still . i ' ll ask her for an interview . what is she , a loo ? that ' s hopeful there ' s a bad time coming up for loo soon . i ' ll go and see her . i wish i ' d stayed in rhodes . i wish i ' d never returned . someone must govern . rome is fortunate that she has you . yes . and i ' m fortunate in you , sejanus . you ' re my ayes and ears . if it wasn ' t for you to relieve me of some of my burden . .. what have we here ? conversations taken down by my agents . some are merely vicious . others treasonable . doesn ' t anybody ever say anything that isn ' t vicious or treasonable ? ! we ' ve had more treason trials in two years than the previous ten ! there is one i think you should look at . hmm . was he the corps commander on the upper rhine ? that ' s the point . " had it not bean for the way i handled my four regiments , " they would have mutinied too . " he said that ? . at a dinner party . what did he mean by it ? . he went on to say that if his regiments had mutinied , tiberius would not be emperor now . he implies that you owe your position to him . oh , well . he ' d had too much wine . you know what old soldiers are like . they like to fight their old battles . i think there may be more to it than that . perhaps it ' s not important . what do you mean ? only that he went on to say , lower down , that the regiments that did mutiny had bean under your command . he probably said it because agrippina was there . a compliment to her late husband whose regiments remained loyal agrippina was at the dinner ? . agrippina ! the noble gaius caligula to see the emperor ! what do you want ? . i ' m busy ! i brought you a present . a present ? . what sort of a present ? . it took me a year to find it . when i heard about it , i said , " that is for my great uncle , tiberius . " happy anniversary ! what of ? . what difference does it make ? think of something . wait till you see the others . where did you get this ? elephantis . a merchant i know told me about it and i asked him to get it for me . it cost quite a lot . it cost so much i had to borrow part of it from uncle claudius ! it ' s 200 years old . it was very thoughtful of you . i knew you ' d like it . in fact i ' d like to borrow it myself some time . i mean , when you ' re not using it . i ' d like you to examine the evidence to see if there ' s a case for impeaching silius caecina . on a charge of treason ? yes . for insulting references towards the emperor ? . why not ? . well . i agree , why not . blasphemies against augustus have bean treasonable , but tiberius ? there ' s no precedent for it . the emperor ' s noble son tiberius drusus caesar ! castor , how nice to see you . welcome back . i ' m castor to my friends , sejanus . i had hoped you ' d count me among your friends . perhaps you will one day . that seems unlikely . your father doesn ' t wish to be disturbed . i want silius caecina impeached for treason . he has a great war record and he has powerful friends - the lady agrippina for one . shall i find someone else or will you take the case ? ! of course . i was just clearing my mind . germanicus was never your enemy ! i tell you he was ! i know what his ambitions were . i have the proof here in the files . and i know how his widow conspires against me now . proof ? . from sejanus ? yes ! from sejanus . he at least keeps me informed of what goes on in this city ! oh , father , open your ayes ! the man is using you . you know nothing he doesn ' t want you to know and see no one he doesn ' t want you to see . he is the partner of my labours . and soon he ' ll be your colleague , but that won ' t be enough for him . that man has an apatite for power unknown to you and me . envy ! envy ! you envy him because for years he worked while you and that judean friend of yours , herod , went whoring around the city ! he worked to relieve me of my labours ! that ' s true , but if you think he ' s working for you , you ' re mistaken . he ' s working for himself , and how hard he works ! have you finished ? no , i have not finished ! his statue is now to be seen in pompay ' s theatre and replicas of it are all over rome ! he ' s built a network of spies that have spread through the city . don ' t you see ? he ' s building a prison here , stone by stone , and one day , when you ' re gone , we ' ll wake up and find the doors locked and the bolts down ! did you have a report to make on the coastal defences ? yes . well . then , make it ! he ' s interested only in treason trials and pornographic books he had one with him . caligula had bought it for him . they seem to get on well he gives me the shudders . how germanicus and agrippina produced him , i don ' t know . did you quarrel with your father ? . we had an argument over sejanus . he ' s blind to that man ' s ambition . don ' t you exaggerate ? no . what can he aspire to - a commander of the guard ? i sometimes think he aspires to sit where my father sits . he doesn ' t realise how much he depends upon him . he seeks his advice on everything . why don ' t you go to sleep ? i don ' t know why i ' m so tired . you ' ve had a long journey . i came to say goodnight , father . goodnight . i ' m glad you ' re back . i ' m sorry i was so tired . i can ' t keep awake . you ' ll feel better in the morning . goodnight , mother . goodnight , helen . she ' s becoming very beautiful yes . her skin ' s not all that it should be though . you too are looking beautiful thank you . why don ' t you stay ? . not tonight . you ' re tired . you ' ll sleep better alone . yes , you ' re right . i really can ' t keep my ayes open . is he asleep ? yes . fast asleep ? yes . no , wait . don ' t be in such a hurry . it ' s much better if you wait . did you do as i said ? put it in his wine ? yes . he ' ll sleep till morning . do ? we ' re going to make love for the last time . last time ? no ! i couldn ' t bear it . i couldn ' t bear it ! livilla . .. he ' ll go away again . it ' s too much of a risk . we ' ll be discovered . it ' s too dangerous . be sensible . how can you be sensible ? i don ' t think you love me , not really . i love you too much to risk exposing you to a charge of adultery . don ' t tempt me , my darling . help me . . i could do what i did tonight . drug his wine ? he ' ll get suspicious if he falls asleep every night . besides , his body would grow accustomed to it and it would cease to have any affect . would a large dose really kill him ? what are you saying ? i can ' t live without you . i can ' t . i think i ' d die if you didn ' t come into my bed every night . it ' s a little step - from making him sleep at night to sleeping forever . you ' ll need something stronger . get it for me . are you sure ? yes ! yes ! are you ? if you are . and afterwards ? i ' ll divorce my wife and we ' ll get married . and then i ' ll have you all to myself . no more lovers for you , then . you ' ll have to behave . and if i don ' t ? . if you don ' t ? . then i ' ll lock you in a room without any clothes , and i ' ll visit you three or four times a day . perhaps you ' ll be too tired . perhaps you ' ll only manage once . then i ' ll send my guards to stand in for me . would you really ? . yes . how many ? . three or four . i might not let them . you ' ll be forced . against my will ? . yes . while you were there ? yes . i ' d struggle and scream . but no use . you ' d like that , wouldn ' t you ? claudius ! herod . castor ? . what ' s your hurry ? . oh , yes . look at this . it came this morning . " the lady livia augustus expects her grandson tiberius claudius drusus " to dine with her on her birthday . she hopes he ' s in good health . " w - what can it mean ? what it says , i imagine . i should take your own wine . it ' s no joke , herod . i ' m very nervous . she never invites me . we haven ' t spoken for seven years . the last time she spoke to me was when caligula burned the house down . then all she said was , " if you haven ' t got a bucket , p - piss on it ! " i remember . your family are all lunatics , you know . in that case , why don ' t you go back to your own family in judea ? i prefer lunatics i know to ones i don ' t . where are you off to ? to find a present for grandmother . what about one of these ? i know that face ! who is it ? . he knows that face ! wonderful ! people know that face better than their own ! is it sejanus ? it ' s a replica of the statue of him at pompay theatre . everyone ' s buying them . everyone had better ! here , have one . n - no , thanks . i ' ve got nowhere to put it . oh , don ' t be obvious , herod . it ' s very tedious . i must go . castor , you ' re not looking well i ' ve not bean well since i returned . how ' s livilla ? i invited her to a p - public reading of my work , but she never came . her tastes have never bean literary . you never came either . that ' s because mine always were . herod , you ' re talented but d - dull i must go . what a dear , divine fool my cousin is . how nervous everything makes him . if i ' d bean asked to dine with your grandmother , i ' d be nervous ! he ' s right , you know . you don ' t look well oh , it ' ll pass . you worry so much . halt ! silius caecina . what ' s this ? i ' m to be arrested , it seems . by whose order ? . by order of the state senate . on what grounds ? on the grounds of treason . gaius silius caecina is to be impeached before the senate . it seems i made some defamatory remarks about your father . i don ' t recall them . this must be some sort of joke , varro . you ' ll be laughed out of the house . i don ' t think so . please stand aside , sir . and help me too , my father , divine ruler of the world . .. to calm the raging spirit inside me , and lighten the dark shadows of my soul . . and bring me peace . peace . hypocrite you sacrifice to augustus , but you persecute his grandchildren . what grandchildren do i persecute that augustus didn ' t ? . i ' m not talking of my brother postumus . i ' m talking of me . of me ! all my friends , one by one , you either banish or you charge them with treason . and their only crime is friendship for me . even lollia , whom you could find nothing against , you degraded and humiliated till she took her own life ! now you ' ve arrested silius caecina . if you are not queen , have i done you wrong ? why do you persist in this childish belief that i want to be queen ? do you need to find reasons for the way you treat me ? and how do i treat you ? you persecute me ! i will not be screamed at even by the granddaughter of augustus ! silius caecina is charged with treasonable utterances . utterances ? what brings the emperorship into disrepute undermines the foundations of the state . tiberius . .. perhaps i do you wrong in thinking you persecute me through my friends . but you do me wrong in thinking me ambitious . i ' m tired . since germanicus died , i ' ve hardly known what to do with myself . all i want is to be left alone . .. and . .. and ? be good to my children . have i not bean good to them ? to caligula , perhaps , but to nero and drusus , you ' re cold and never enquire after them . oh , tiberius , let ' s not fight one another all the time . as for your children , they are guiltless of any crime . i will look upon them as friends . as for you . .. i will never forget what you made me do to piso . tiberius claudius drusus nero germanicus . happy b - b - birthday , grandmother . oh , is that for me ? yes . it ' s a v - v - vase . from india . how very pretty . and from such a distant place . it ' s a pity we never got that far . so many things we could have got cheap . sit down , my dear , and eat . c - caligula . uncle . staking everything on one throw , uncle claudius ? hold your tongue . that was a gesture of confidence in me and was much appreciated . have you had l - lots of lovely presents , grandmother ? . several . my dear . thrasyllus has drawn the most detailed horoscope . such work has gone into it . amazing . a horoscope full of incident and prophecy . i was amazed at it myself . it was a present from tiberius . he wanted to know how much longer i ' m going to live . i assure you . .. oh , shut up . it ' s a foolish mother who doesn ' t know her son . and d - did he find out ? . yes , yes . i shall die soon . next year some time . my son will be relieved . i shall tell him nothing . it would be a breach of professional ethics . you ' re a liar . like all good astrologers , you ' re a liar . you can go now . they tell the truth about the future , but lie their way out of the present . let me reassure you , i could be wrong . if you ' re mistaken over the exact time of your birth by a fraction , it could mean another ten years . you see , he can ' t resist it . they ' re all insecure , astrologers . they all want to be loved . go away , thrasyllus , you ' ll get no love here . what are you grinning at , monster ? . you are a monster , aren ' t you ? whatever you say , great grandmother . did you know he was a monster , claudius ? is he old enough to have acquired that t - title ? he started very young , didn ' t you , monster ? . i seerched his room one day and i found a little green talisman that told me a very remarkable story - or confirmed one i ' d heard from another quarter . a g - green talisman ? like my brother wore ? the one your brother wore . do you think it ' s safe that uncle claudius should be told my secret ? . or are you going to poison him ? oh , he ' s quite safe . and remember this , monster , your uncle claudius here is a phenomenon . because he ' s sworn to protect his brother ' s children , he will never harm you . and remember this too . thrasyllus has prophesied that he will avenge your death , so you cannot harm him . i didn ' t think much of that . never mind what you thought , just remember it . now you may go . i want to talk to claudius in private . goodnight , great grandmother . goodnight , uncle . my body fascinates him because it ' s so old . you ' d think it would repel him . why do you allow him such f - f - familiarity ? . because it pleases him . and because he will be the next emperor . you don ' t believe me , do you ? if you say so , grandmother . you know i don ' t concern myself with high p - politics , but what about castor ? . and caligula has two older brothers . castor is ill thrasyllus says he won ' t recover . he also says that tiberius will choose caligula to succeed him . why ? . vanity . tiberius wants to be loved - at least after his death if not before . and the best way to ensure that . .. is to have someone w = worse to follow him . well . he ' s certainly no fool he ' s the biggest fool in my family . i always thought that was you . .. but i think now i was wrong . grandmother , after all these years , you didn ' t invite me to dinner to tell me this . wine has made you bold . you kept in with caligula because he is the next emperor . lost your stutter too . but if you ' re dead , what difference can it make to you ? oh , it makes a lot of difference . and that ' s really why you ' re here . i want to be a goddess , claudius . thrasyllus says he ' s sure i will be , which means he ' s not sure , he just thinks i will why are you so anxious to be a goddess ? oh , don ' t you understand ? do you believe that the souls of criminals suffer eternal torment ? . certainly . but that the immortal gods are free from fear of punishment ? . of course . jove deposed his father , killed one of his grandsons and married his own sister . he ' s the greatest god of all i ' ve done many terrible things , claudius . no ruler could do otherwise . but i ' ve always put the good of the empire above all else . who saved rome from civil war again ? i did . augustus would have plunged us into it time and again with his ridiculous favouritism . he set agrippa against marcellus , gaius against tiberius , tiberius against postumus . there was no end to his follies . and it fell to me to . .. remove them - one by one . don ' t say you never suspected . that ' s why i tolerate caligula . he ' s sworn , if i keep his secret . .. he ' ll make me a goddess as soon as he becomes emperor . you too must swear that you ' ll do all you can to see it happens . don ' t you see ? if he doesn ' t make me a goddess , i ' ll be in hell . hell suffering torments day and night , year after year after year . grandmother , p - please don ' t distress yourself . of course i ' ll do what i can . thank you . on one small condition . you see , there ' s so much i want to know . i ' m an historian and i want to know the truth . when people die , so much dies with them , and all that ' s left are pieces of paper that tell lies . lies , lies . he wants to know the truth and he calls it a small condition . grandmother , who killed marcellus ? i did . the empire needed agrippa more than it needed marcellus . and then i poisoned agrippa later because i knew that his wife was in love with tiberius , and if tiberius married her augustus would make him emperor . my son botched that up , of course . and j - julia ' s sons by agrippa . how did they die ? gaius i had poisoned when he was in syria . you have a long reach . the empire ' s very large . i need one . lucius was drowned in a boating accident arranged by his friend plautius . and postumus ? you were fond of him , weren ' t you ? yes , grandmother . he was useless . i had to get rid of him . he was a threat to tiberius . besides , he knew i ' d had his mother banished . and what about my father , who was your son , and germanicus , who was my dear brother - did you poison them ? no . your father died of his wound . plancina poisoned germanicus without instructions from me . but i ' d marked them both down for death . why ? . they were both infected with that disorder known as republicanism . so was i . yes , but you didn ' t count . if i ever had the opportunity , do you know the first thing i ' d do ? restore the republic . then you are a fool after all and what about augustus ? did you poison him ? yes . yes , i did . i smeared the poison on the figs while they were still on the tree . i had no choice . he would only eat them if he ' d picked them himself . it took me all night to do it . how could you have done that , grandmother , when you ' d lived with him for so long ? yes . that was hard . very hard . that was the hardest thing i ever had to do . take this . read it some time . that is a collection of sihylline verses rejected from the official book . why ? . because it ' s prophesied there that you will one day be emperor . yes . you . anything you say , grandmother . you won ' t forget your promise ? no , i won ' t . if i can become emperor , you can certainly become the queen of heaven ! tiberius claudius drusus nero germanicus claudius , dear fellow . how nice to see you . i w = was on my way to see castor . i ' m told he ' s v - very bad . yes , but he ' ll recover , i ' m sure . your sister is taking care of him . actually , i wanted to have a word with you . what about ? . this may seem an odd question to put to a husband , but did you know your wife was pregnant ? . no . n - n - no , i d - didn ' t . how do you know ? . i know . well . it ' s n - nothing to do with me . we haven ' t even s - spoken for a long time . you ' ll have to divorce her . what for ? . you can ' t be married to a woman who ' s bearing someone else ' s child . your uncle will expect you to divorce her . oh . well . of course i ' ll d - d - divorce her . whom will you marry ? . m - marry ? . i ' m getting d - divorced . but you won ' t want to live alone . i was l - living alone when i was m - married . then it doesn ' t matter whether you marry or not . i ' d rather not . nonsense . i have just the woman for you . beautiful . independent - she ' ll leave you alone when you like . w - who is she ? my sister . aelia . well . she w = wouldn ' t w = want to marry a lame , sick fool like me . she wouldn ' t mind . you ' re the emperor ' s nephew . that ' s a good alliance . and on your side , you ' d be my brother - in - law . i ' ve spoken to the emperor . he ' s given his consent . oh , in that case , anything you say , sejanus . good ! well . that ' s settled . that ' s very decent of you , sejanus . thanks a lot . he ' s dying . dying . i asked to see the emperor to convey my sympathies on his son ' s death . he sent word he never wanted to see me again . a nod is as good as a wink from there ! where will you go , herod ? back to judea ? no , no . to edom . my grandfather , herod the great came from there . it was your father , mark antony , who made him king of the jews . he did them no favour . he did my grandfather no favour either . the jews drive all their rulers mad . what will you do in edom ? i understand there ' s nothing there . oh , i shall . . you know . grandfather ' s domains were divided among his three surviving sons . that he had three left is a miracle for he murdered the rest . i think he overlooked them ! a colourful character . if black is colourful . he was colourful from there , i shall decide which of my three uncles is the safest touch and make my plans accordingly . you must marry . i have someone in mind . a roman ? no , lady . we jews believe in marrying only among ourselves . you ' re a very arrogant people . practical there are so many things we can ' t eat ! no gentile woman would stand it ! what ' s this , claudius , about your marriage ? for claudius ? he ' s already married . but he ' s getting a divorce to marry sejanus ' sister . is this true ? well . i . .. s - s - sejanus t - t . .. oh , get it out ! my wife , urganalilla , is apparently having a baby and it ' s not mine . it wouldn ' t be . you never see her . that ' s the p - point . so sejanus suggested i divorce her and m - m - marry his sister . i ' ve never heard anything so monstrously wicked in all my life . you ' re a bigger fool than i thought . well . w = what difference does it make to me ? i shan ' t see her either . fool germanicus would have had no patience with you . p - probably . can ' t you see the vile ambition that drives that man ? it ' s just another step on the way . by this marriage , he relates himself to the imperial family . then does he plan to marry livilla ? what has he to do with livilla ? he ' s her lover . sejanus is married with children ! what kind of world do you think we ' re living in ? ! i ' m sorry . i ' m upset . castor ' s dead . silius caecina committed suicide even before the trial had ended . one by one my friends vanish . where will it end ? you ' ve betrayed us ! oh , pina . .. why did you agree to it ? . well . . he asked me . is that all you can say ? . you blockhead ! no . he ' s not a blockhead . it ' s we who are the blockheads . if sejanus had come to us with a proposal like that , we ' d have said no , but claudius knows better . claudius sways and bends with each little wind that blows . you mean he ' s weak and cowardly . perhaps . but at least he ' s still here ! but at least he ' s still here . yes still here . and they ' ve all gone , every one of them . it ' s like a dream - dreamed by livia sleeping fitfully down in hell no . livia is dying . dying . the mother of the nation is dying . livia is dying . she ' s sent for you . she wants to see you . why , i can ' t imagine . dying ? yes . but it was only a cold . it ' s settled on her lungs . she ' s sinking fast . she ' s asked to see you . well . are you going to sit there all night ? . i hear you ' re dying , great grandmother . you won ' t forget your promise , will you ? to make you a goddess ? what makes you think a smelly old woman could become a goddess ? i don ' t need you any more , you see , great grandmother . my secret will die with you . you ' re going to stew in hell for ever and ever . let me tell you something . thrasyllus has made another prophecy . he told tiberius . he said one who is going to die soon will become the greatest god the world has ever known . no temples will be dedicated to anyone but him in the whole world . not even to augustus . and do you know who that one is ? me . me . i shall become the greatest god of all . and i shall look down on you , suffering all the torments of hell . and i shall say . .. " leave her there . " leave her there for ever and ever and ever . " goodbye , great grandmother . how are you , grandmother ? . d - don ' t cry . he was here . .. caligula was here . he said he wouldn ' t make me a goddess . i ' ll see that he does , grandmother . he said . .. he said he ' d leave me to stew in hell i want to be a goddess , claudius . i deserve it . you shall be the queen of heaven . i promise you . really ? . yes . go on playing the fool . claudius . goodbye , grandmother . safe journey .
otogi zoshi traveler , you must not look back wander on where the wind takes you the steps you take will guide you on your way journey on into the unknown there ' s a voice you cannot forget though it may bring you to tears you must live with all your might just think of your homeland and all your grief will vanish and all your grief will vanish throw old notions by the wayside go , go , until you ' ve slashed through the sunset look up toward those distant memories go , go , until you ' ve smashed through the sunset urabe , if only you were here right now . there are so many things i want to ask you ! it is the heian period in japan . shuten doji has led the kumaso troops in an attack on heian - kyo . hikaru and the others are heading for ooeyama to save the capital . act ten : shuten lacking summer flowers one who brings forth again the flower of the spring now past shows not the timely bloom . are you saying that now is the time for change ? but if that ' s the case , then we must aid lord raikou all the more . lord seimei . .. urabe , i wish to put an end to all the suffering in the world . you understand . .. do you not , urabe ? lord seimei . .. stop that cowering ! abe no seimei has arrived . send him in . seimei , what should we do ? those blasted insurgents seem to be quite fierce . .. the god of victory , the god of defeat the battle lines have been drawn , and we shall surely be protected . .. the capital shall be protected by the god of victory . are you quite certain ? is that so ? of course , you ' re right ! in that case , it will be possible to go ahead with the succession ceremony on the day you proposed . minister of the left , it won ' t be much longer until our dreams are realized . keep up the good work ! lord shuten , may i ask what is going on here ? our agreement was to act three days from now . besides , when are you going to hand over the magatama of fire ? if i recall , you had promised to deliver the magatama to the onmyo ryo as soon as you arrived in the capital ! in return for this , we informed you of the date of the succession ceremony when defences will be spread thin . that ' s right , i ' d forgotten . .. it slipped my mind ! i ' d totally forgotten to properly entertain my guest from the onmyo - ryo ! being that i ' m just a country bumpkin i have no grasp of heian - kyo etiquette . pray forgive me ! so shuten ' s sake isn ' t good enough for you , you say ? damn you capital men ! make sure you release every last one of those musasabi by sundown ! do not let up ! bastards ! they ' re pulling out all the goddamned stops ! i can ' t take it anymore ! sadamitsu . .. taisho ! i ' m going to go kick the living crap out of them ! got that ? come back here , sadamitsu ! shut up ! doesn ' t it make you sick to see the capital being laid to waste like that ? what the hell did we risk our lives for , chasing after the magatamas ? sadamitsu ! what is it , taisho ? you gonna try to stop me , too ? you ' re not the only one who feels bitter . what the hell ? i would like nothing more than to go after them myself . but what good would it do to vanquish only the kumaso troops ? have you forgotten what our objective is ? what we need to accomplish now is to compel shuten doji to stop the carnage , and then seize the magatama ! and for that to happen , we ' re going to need you by our side . sadamitsu ! guess you ' re right . i ' ll go with you . there ' s just one thing , though . .. i ' m going to follow you all the way to the bottom of hell . .. you keep that in mind , t aisho ! right . we shall stop shuten doji no matter what ! and then we shall save the capital ourselves ! come on , let ' s go . what do you think , ibaraki ? i ' ve got the capital in the palm of my hand now . it ' s up to me whether those people live or die ! amusing , wouldn ' t you say ? lord shuten , if i may , i cannot see the justification behind your actions today . what you have launched is nothing but a massacre ! l - lord shuten . .. ibaraki . .. how kind - hearted you are . even worrying your pretty head over the people of the capital ! the capital belongs to me now . it ' s up to me to decide what happens next . the reason we came here was to secure a promise from the capital not to attack chinzei . i ' m sure the other clans are here for the same reason ! and besides . .. besides ? we kumasos have a splendid homeland of our own in chinzei , remember ? should we not sign a peace treaty with the capital and return to chinzei immediately ? since when are you so high and mighty that you can tell me what to do ? have you forgotten our blood - soaked past ? all the torture our clan suffered by those in the capital for so long ? we ' re here to settle an old score , that ' s all ! but now we are in a position to speak on equal terms with the capital . please , reconsider ! if you find my decisions so revolting , then you have two choices . .. either go back to chinzei right now , alone . .. or kill me where i stand ! all i want is to go back to the way it was before . .. all of us pulling together to live our lives in chinzei . .. is that it ? we ' re almost there . come on ! get back here ! almost got it . .. that little moron ! ouch . .. you little idiot ! come back with me right now ! wait a second , where are my rice balls ? found them ! i ' m going down there , too . wait , tsuna ! are you from the land of dewa ? we kumasos have come to battle ready to forfeit our lives to retaliate against the capital . yet you have your child in tow . get yourself back to your post at once ! kintaro ! are you all right ? you stood your ground well ! sadamitsu . .. the gunpowder shells are just a decoy ! no need to guard the gates . all warriors are hereby ordered to retreat within the city and protect the lmperial palace ! dammit ! we are on foot . even if we returned to the capital now , we couldn ' t possibly overtake them . lord raikou . .. that ' s right . we ' re the only ones who have infiltrated ooeyama . right ! i ' m going to throttle that bastard shuten with my bare hands ! okay . we must hurry ! should we bust in there ? i don ' t want to wage a futile battle . we should avoid unnecessary conflict . so i ' m going to go in alone . but lord raikou , that would be folly ! i want you to wait here for me . i am going with you , my lord . who the hell are you , you bastard ? i am minamoto no raikou . i have come to ask a favor of you . i ' m asking you to stop this barbaric attack immediately ! i have seen it , the kumaso homeland ! there i saw your people , who have nothing but the utmost faith in you ! if you have a grievance with the capital , let me intercede with the emperor . please , withdraw your troops immediately ! a visit from a crazy little brat , huh ? not only that , but he dares to show up here unarmed ! shuten doji ! remember , you have a magnificent homeland in chinzei . who will lead your people if you are not there ? i thought the sake tasted piss - poor tonight , is that your doing ? shuten doji ! if you persist with this brutality , there will be hell to pay . withdraw your troops at once , and hand over the magatama of fire ! fine ! you go back to the capital and tell abe no seimei for me ! that the kumasos will withdraw at once , just as we promised ! well , now ! does that mean . .. i give you my word ! as soon as i ' ve killed you and burned the capital to the ground , that is ! lord shuten ! who wants to be next , huh ? please , stop ! i didn ' t come here to fight ! now then , why don ' t you tell me your little story ? if you have nothing to say , then i have no choice . .. taisho , there ' s no use trying to talk sense into him . there ' s no way to get the magatama except by overpowering him ! that ' s right , power ! power is everything ! what could be easier to understand ? if you lay a finger on lord shuten . .. you ' ll have to answer to ibaraki ! i have no more arrows ! i , too , have run out ! you animals won ' t have your way with the house of minamoto ! sake , give me sake . .. sake ! lord shuten , you mustn ' t ! you ' re dead ! lord shuten , please stop ! lord shuten ! miss ibaraki ! lord shuten . .. it ' s a demon ! power is everything . let ' s see you stop me with what little power you have ! goddamn you . .. lord shuten . .. let ' s just go home now . to our homeland . .. ibaraki . .. lord raikou ! lord raikou , are you all right ? you people . .. isn ' t this what you wanted ? take it with you . hurry ! but you mustn ' t let seimei have it , ever . .. what is abe no seimei planning to do ? i don ' t know . all i know is that seimei has no regard for human life . if only lord shuten had never met that man ! we could ' ve lived a happy life back in our homeland . i know you want to protect your homeland , too . go on , now . hurry ! there ' s no stopping our soldiers now . .. lord raikou . .. the stars are so beautiful . they ' re the same stars we saw at home . lord shuten . .. urabe ! are you all right , urabe ? you were so late returning from the onmyo - ryo . .. we were all worried about you . hey , now the old gang ' s finally back together again . i ' m just not as sharp without you around , urabe ! urabe ! urabe . .. what ' s the matter ? hey , we have rice balls ! i see you were able to obtain the magatama . .. that ' s right . urabe , were you able to talk to seimei ? what ' s going on , urabe ? urabe ? please forgive me ! lord raikou ! urabe ! lord raikou ! urabe . .. urabe ! urabe ! urabe ! the group was reunited but for a fleeting moment . .. to be continued . .. outside the window , the rain is falling , shutting us in . if you feel bad about today , then come pick me up . that ' s what i want to say , but i can ' t . .. the dreams that i wished upon a star are all coming true , one by one . yet i just can ' t seem to catch up with you . the dreams that i wished upon a star are all coming true , so . .. i want to get closer to you . there is a secret that i have never revealed to any of you , my companions . i never told you that i am actually an onmyoji a disciple of abe no seimei himself . what lord seimei ' s true agenda is , even i cannot tell you . nevertheless , i am still an onmyoji . act eleven , enmity . don ' t miss it !
otogi zoshi traveler , you must not look back wander on where the wind takes you the steps you take will guide you on your way journey on into the unknown there ' s a voice you cannot forget though it may bring you to tears you must live with all your might just think of your homeland and all your grief will vanish and all your grief will vanish throw old notions by the wayside go , go , until you ' ve slashed through the sunset look up toward those distant memories go , go , until you ' ve smashed through the sunset it is the heian period in japan . hikaru and the others are on their way back from ooeyama in pursuit of urabe . they are about to see the kumaso forces ravage the capital . act ten : enmity hey , listen ! when we get back to the capital we ' re heading for the onmyo - ryo , right ? yes , the first step will be for seimei to gather all of the magatamas . i ' m sure that ' s where we ' ll find urabe . you know what i think ? i don ' t believe that urabe betrayed us ! neither do i . i agree with tsuna . me too ! me too ! i can understand the taisho believing in her . but look , tsuna , you distrusted urabe more than anyone , remember ? i do not know what led urabe to join lord raikou ' s quest . but she has always acted in lord raikou ' s interests . how many times has she saved us from disaster ? hey , i always thought you only had eyes for the t aisho . .. but you did see what was going on around you , huh ? urabe . .. i know urabe will come back to us ! metal conquers wood , wood conquers earth , earth conquers water water conquers fire , fire conquers metal . but this is . .. the enmity of the five elements ! but lord seimei , by its very essence the word " enmity " ultimately leads to a curse that kills , surely you are aware of that . if you are truly looking out for the people , why curse them ? is it not possible to celebrate those lives instead ? if your intent is to purge the world of its suffering then rid the world of nothing else . seimei ! is seimei here ? seimei , you assured us there was nothing to fear so we took you at your word . but the disturbance is escalating by the minute ! how can we hold the succession ceremony now ? never mind that , what about those gunpowder shells ? i ' m so terrified i can barely breathe ! seimei , what are we to do ? hmm ? well , now ! you have the magatama of fire ! seimei , does that mean . .. yes , my lord . he who sets the last magatama in place shall see his desires fulfilled and the world shall change . well done ! look here , give him the magatama of fire ! minister of the left , please hurry ! don ' t rush me . the last magatama shall be set down by no other hand than mine . now then , the magatama ! until i have heard from lord seimei himself what he intends i cannot hand over the magatama . give it to him now ! that is , if you wish to save the capital . .. answer me , please , lord seimei ! as is said in secret rituals . .. this is no time to lose your footing . forgive me . is this . .. can this be the once - thriving capital ? lord seimei . .. are your true intentions never to be revealed to me ? during the course of my travels with lord raikou , i came to know the people of the capital , the pirates of the setouchi sea , the kumaso . .. true , they are called by different names , yet they all manage to survive by clinging loyally to their families , their friends . what is this drivel you utter , woman ? i saw people looking out for each other , sharing in each other ' s joy and sorrow . my entire life has been spent studying here in the capital . those people were a noble , beautiful sight to see ! that ' s enough ! hand over that magatama right now ! lord seimei . .. i now share lord raikou ' s feelings . i wish to save as many of these people as i can . .. they who struggle so mightily to live in the ruins of this world . .. i wish to live my life alongside theirs ! lord raikou is a young warrior . it is not possible for him to understand my intentions . however , urabe , you of all people should understand ! i do not understand ! lord seimei , i am heartbroken . i have always had nothing but the highest respect for you , my mentor but i , urabe , can no longer follow your lead ! the lord seimei i know always prayed for others . you cared not only for the emperor , but for all people everywhere . .. not just here , but those living in distant villages as well . .. they never left your thoughts . do you not see ? i do this because i care about all . .. do you not see this ? you of all people . .. it is a mystery to me . why you are driven to do such a terrible thing . .. lord seimei . .. please forgive me ! come back here , you ! somebody stop that woman ! a mere woman like her won ' t get far . don ' t let her leave the onmyo - ryo ! yes , sir ! she won ' t get too far , she ' s just a woman . she ' s sure to be hiding somewhere nearby . don ' t leave any stone unturned ! in all things , perfection is located at the point of harmonic balance between yin and yang . lord seimei . .. what on earth do you mean by " perfection " ? i don ' t hear a sound . no one ' s around . surely seimei knows that we ' d be in pursuit of the magatama . you ' d think he ' d be lying in wait for us . .. lord raikou , this is the onmyo - ryo , we must not let down our guard . the place is empty . so we were too late ? but seimei must have been here until just a short while ago , praying . .. man , this place is totally musty ! sure is . .. urabe ! lord raikou . i know that i acted out of line , please forgive me . you must hurry now to rashomon ! rashomon ? urabe , why did you take the magatama ? my lord . .. ever since i can remember , i have lived my life by lord seimei ' s teachings because i believed it was the path i was meant to take . i believed that it was lord seimei who would bring peace to the capital . little did i know that . .. please , you must forgive me ! i was prepared to die along with the magatama of fire if it came to that but this too i was denied . i had no idea you were in such turmoil . .. the five magatamas were placed not in a pentagon of affinity but rather a pentacle of enmity . enmity ? affinity is the power to save , enmity the power to destroy . lord raikou , were you aware that before you began your quest for the magatamas , a punitive force from the capital had already recovered two . .. first metal , then wood ? but i thought the wishes of whoever set down the last magatama would be granted ? mere subterfuge for recovering all of the magatamas . .. the end result will be quite different , depending on whether they were gathered in the order of affinity or enmity . indeed , the tsuchigumo clan , the pirates , and the kumaso clan the very path we traveled , seeking the magatamas was in itself the path towards enmity . .. but the capital . .. if the magatamas are restored in the order of enmity what will become of the capital ? the magatamas will be released from the cursed seal , emanating five pillars of light that will envelope the capital . all will be destroyed , the lives of the people will be taken . it can ' t be . .. i went after the magatamas believing it would save the people . .. but all those battles we fought . .. what have i done ? for what reason ? what have i . .. urabe . .. what ' s the matter ? was it seimei ? did seimei do this to you ? urabe ! urabe ! urabe . .. before the five pillars of light arise . .. you must stop lord seimei . .. urabe ! urabe , you mustn ' t give up ! stay with us ! urabe ! forgive me , lord tsuna . .. you must look after lord raikou . .. please ! urabe ! urabe ! come on , urabe ! urabe ! urabe ! damn you ! kintaro , real men don ' t cry so easily . let ' s go . we ' re going to foil seimei ' s plot at any cost , to save the capital . for urabe ' s sake as well . .. we have been ordered to execute minamoto no raikou and the men under his command . are you insane ? we have come to stop abe no seimei from carrying out . .. silence ! taking advantage of this chaos to usurp the magatamas a heinous offense indeed . therefore , the minister of the left has issued a warrant for your execution as traitors . this is absurd ! how dare they call lord raikou a traitor ?

otogi zoshi traveler , you must not look back wander on where the wind takes you the steps you take will guide you on your way journey on into the unknown there ' s a voice you cannot forget though it may bring you to tears you must live with all your might just think of your homeland and all your grief will vanish and all your grief will vanish throw old notions by the wayside go , go , until you ' ve slashed through the sunset look up toward those distant memories go , go , until you ' ve smashed through the sunset only one more to go . .. what ' s going on ? t aisho ! no . .. mansairaku ! entrusted with the hopes of her companions hikaru now faces the confrontation of her life with mansairaku . act thirteen : hikaru you ' re to be commended for getting this far , minamoto no raikou or rather , hikaru ! mansairaku . .. but why ? how can you be seimei ? the capital shall be reborn . how can you be abe no seimei , mansairaku ? everything and everyone shall be reborn . you and i as well . .. that ' s not it ! the mansairaku i know would never do such a terrible thing ! how could you and seimei have been the same person ? to imitate an old man , that is the art of sarugaku dance . just like you . raikou and hikaru . .. those are your two faces , are they not ? i have two faces as well . .. one yin , one yang . as a sarugaku dancer , i am called upon to entertain the nobles and as an onmyoji , i use the information i ' ve gathered to manipulate those same nobles ! it can ' t be true ! the mansairaku i know would never do such a cruel thing ! ripened fruit eventually falls off the tree . rotten fruit cannot be allowed to cling , lest the trunk rot as well . mansairaku , do you even realize what you ' re about to do ? there can be no creation without destruction . a new vessel is necessary to receive the new world . are you insane ? take another look with those eyes of yours , mansairaku ! the capital , and all its people are suffering now because of you ! it was you who taught me that the suffering must be saved ! that is why you and i shall save the capital together ! what ? i have long observed this with my own eyes . no matter how many times a new emperor was crowned the corrupt politics of the court never changed . the nobles , the onmyojis , and the warriors all live for their own glory ! even the commoners live a cutthroat existence . that is the true face of this " capital of peace " . .. all the more reason why i want to save the capital ! don ' t you understand that , mansairaku ? just as human life is finite , the lifespan of the capital , too , is finite . the capital seems to have lived longer than it should have . how can you be so arrogant ? at this very moment , the people of the capital are struggling to survive ! just listen to them , mansairaku ! please don ' t cause them any more suffering than you already have ! alas , you were too late , hikaru . the capital has already passed through its yin phase and is now moving into its yang phase . there ' s nothing you can do at this point . a barrier shall envelope us once i ' ve intoned my curse . this will lay the foundation for a great rebirth . .. in other words , the demise of the capital . it pleases me that we shall be together when that time comes , hikaru . stop it ! please , you ' ve got to stop , mansairaku ! mansairaku , if nothing will stop you from doing this , then . .. then i will kill you ! that which is pure is of the heavens , that which is impure is of the earth . yin and yang merge into that which we call the universe . .. the pentacle chamber shall be placed on the lotus pedestal . .. the 28 constellations form the three realms . .. why ? why ? water shall reverse itself and conquer fire and the end of all things shall be seen in the heavens . mansairaku . .. how i wish you ' d only known me as hikaru ! was that out of kindness ? the capital cannot be saved by mere kindness . stop it , mansairaku . .. stop it ! you ' ve got to give it up ! there is nothing on earth you can do now ! once i ' ve intoned the curse , all will end ! accept that , and wait here for that time to come ! in that case i ' ll stop you myself ! i pray to you , summon the true nature of suzaku . stop it ! it ' s no use , hikaru . it ' s not in you to kill me . you ' ve got to stop , mansairaku ! just do as i say and help lay the foundation for the new world , hikaru . together , with me . for the sake of my friends my brother and for the people of the capital . .. mansairaku , i will kill you ! and i shall save the capital ! it ' s over ! mansairaku ! mansairaku , why ? you did it , hikaru . but a weak thrust like that won ' t be enough to kill me . just one more push . you ' ve got to push it in deeper , hikaru . mansairaku . .. why ? why are you making me do such a terrible thing ? why must i fight you , of all people ? i am only waging this battle for the sake of my friends , for the sake of my dead brother , for the sake of everyone ! and yet , why must i fight you ? why ? tell me why ! please tell me why , mansairaku ! why is it that you and i must be enemies in this battle ? destiny . it is destiny . it is your destiny , and mine . destiny ? you and i were destined to meet , and to create the capital anew that is the fate that you and i share . but , no . .. my powers alone can accomplish nothing . unless you and i join hands in this , there can be no rebirth for the capital . then that means , i recovered the magatamas for . .. now that you and i and all of the magatamas are here . .. only now can creation begin anew . if i hadn ' t recovered them . .. then , if only i hadn ' t recovered the magatamas then none of this would have happened ! it can ' t be ! all those people who suffered and gave up their lives over the magatamas . .. tenchi nichigetsu sansei sonshin . .. kyuusei sandal gyokujoshin . .. . kyuu kyuu nyo ritsuryou ! that ' s the 5th pillar of light ! taisho , so you didn ' t make it in time . .. kintaro , i bet you ' re wishing you didn ' t stay with me here in the capital , huh ? hey , i had a lot of fun hanging with you , sadamitsu ! same here , kintaro ! i couldn ' t save it . .. i couldn ' t save the capital after all . .. tsuna , urabe , sadamitsu , kintaro , and my brother raikou . .. please forgive me . .. it ' s beyond my control now . .. hikaru . .. mansairaku . .. forgive me . .. i think if i just leave everything the way it is . .. i ' ll have nothing , nothing to lose at all . now that you ' re not here with me under this sky . .. why should i go on living ? tell me why . .. the countless times you showed me kindness . .. the unforgettable words you spoke to me . .. here in my shattered dreams , i ' m still trying to find them somehow . we hurt each other , we loved each other and took from each other , you and i . they had yet to see the light , those little wings of yours if only i could have somehow saved them . those faraway memories i keep locked inside me . .. those mistakes i made that i can never erase . .. we were left with wounds that can never be healed , you and i . just one word . .. that word i couldn ' t say to you . looks like it ' s over now . .. hey , how about getting off me now , kintaro ?

otogi zoshi traveler , you must not look back wander on where the wind takes you the steps you take will guide you on your way journey on into the unknown there ' s a voice you cannot forget though it may bring you to tears you must live with all your might just think of your homeland and all your grief will vanish and all your grief will vanish throw old notions by the wayside go , go , until you ' ve slashed through the sunset look up toward those distant memories go , go , until you ' ve smashed through the sunset i have made up my mind . it is the heian period in japan . in order to recover the final missing magatama , the magatama of fire hikaru and her companions are headed deep into chinzei territory where the kumaso clan led by shuten doji have their stronghold . act eight red demon you can tell we ' re in the south . it ' s still somewhat humid , even this late in the day . yes , it is . are you all right ? yes . hey , what are you doing ? there ' s something around here that smells amazing ! man , you thinking about food again ? it ' s that way ! hey , wait up ! sadamitsu ! i thought i smelled something delicious and i was right ! i picked a whole bunch of them , enough for you too ! all right , i ' ll have one later . huh ? lady urabe . do you know if there are any yellow - haired soldiers among the kumasos ? i ' ve never heard of such a thing . why do you ask ? uh , no special reason . so is that it ? so that ' s the kumaso stronghold , huh ? let ' s get a closer look to make sure . good idea . all we can do now is try to find out as much as we can about this fortress . yes , you ' re right . i have never seen that kind of architecture before . could such a diverse culture have taken hold in this part of the country ? look how big it is . that means there must be a sizable force in there . what are we gonna do ? all this light and sound ? could it be a gunpowder shell ? what ' s that ? it ' s something that i once read about . a ball of fire that explodes with a tremendous flash of light if thrown the gunpowder shell ! i knew that this technology was invented overseas , in china but i never dreamed that the kumasos had it as well ! this is no time to be blown away . we ' re retreating ! here comes another one ! run ! heian - kyo onmyo - ryo at this time of year , the crispness in the air following a rainfall is quite sublime . indeed . seimei , the minister of the right and i have taken the trouble of coming here to the onmyo - ryo for a reason . we feel that it ' s time to decide on a date for the new emperor to ascend the throne . indeed . when would be a good day , seimei ? the next tsuchinoe day would be most opportune . tsuchinoe ? the day that the previous emperor collapsed ? you would have his successor mark this joyous occasion on such an ill - fated day ? yang is produced in a yin environment , that is when yin and yang can achieve perfect harmony . layering yin over yin would do little to enhance the quality of this balance . is that so ? what do you think , minister of the right ? hmm , let me see . .. such is the opinion of seimei . i don ' t see that we have a choice . i suppose you ' re right . all right , then that ' s what we ' ll do . with each change of the seasons , there should be one rare flower among all the temporary blooms . how fragrant are the hydrangeas . .. it is just as i once read in a document from china . they are making these by mixing saltpeter , sulfur , and charcoal . i might be able to come up with a similar device if i can get ahold of those materials . really ? of course , i shall need some time , but yes . in order to get into that fortress and take back the magatama it looks like we ' re going to have to throw them into a state of chaos . if it ' s at all possible , i ' d like you to try . yes , my lord . after all , this is the last magatama . i do not wish to see the people in the capital suffering any more than you do . hey , kintaro , you said you were born on ashigarayama mountain , right ? uh - huh . so where ' s your mother ? mother ? i don ' t have one . don ' t have one ? where were you born , sadamitsu ? i was born in the capital , but my father and mother are both dead . is the capital a cool place ? that ' s right , you ' ve never been there , huh ? so is the capital a cool place or not ? well , i guess you could say it ' s pretty cool . the women are hot , and the sake ' s damn good . this time of year , the hydrangeas should be in bloom too . hydrangeas ? can you eat those ? flowers , they ' re flowers ! if push came to shove , i guess you could eat them , though . that reminds me , when i was a kid i used to go over to suzaku - ln all the time to see the hydrangeas . they ' d be blooming all over the walls . .. you never saw anything prettier . but the priest there was scary . if he caught you there , he ' d whack you good . hey , pay attention , you ! oh , hell . .. still , i guess neither one of us has a place to go home to . .. what ' s so great about having a place to go home to ? good question . i guess i don ' t know the answer . .. look , i ' ve made one ! so this is a gunpowder shell ! i am astonished that you were actually able to make one . it doesn ' t look like it ' ll taste any good . it is not something to eat ! well , then , would you show us how powerful that shell is ? very well . so far we haven ' t heard a peep from that thing ! perhaps there ' s a flaw in the connection between the fuse and the saltpeter ? you mean it ' s no good ? then i ' ll go get it for you ! no , wait ! you ' d better give it a few more minutes . .. i just hope the kid ' s not planning to take a bite out of that thing ! surely not ! oh , no , just as i feared ! still , i was right ! that was the right design to use , wasn ' t it ? this is not the time to be overcome with joy ! hey , kintaro ! are you alive ? that tasted really bitter . sadamitsu , i wouldn ' t try it if i were you ! the bastards from the capital will only come to destroy us if we stay here . it all comes down to whoever strikes first ! hey , just think about it . we ' ve got a powerful ally . it ' s the chance of a lifetime . as long as he ' s on our side , we can ' t go wrong . so come with me ! looks like you ' re still clinging to the memories of your past . you told me that you were happy here . but it ' s clear that at this point in time , your heart is somewhere else . am i wrong ? what do you think ? amazing ! well done , urabe ! that was prodigious . thank you very much . so this is the power of the gunpowder shell . .. now , how can we use these gunpowder shells to our advantage ? our strategy will be to throw the fortress into a state of chaos . these gunpowder shells are merely the supporting cast . the most crucial role will be played by this ! and what is that ? this cylinder represents the core of our strategy . to prevail when vastly outnumbered one must exceed the enemy ' s expectations . are those things gonna work , though ? but of course . my extensive testing will certainly bear this out . our attack on the fortress shall be called " operation scarlet dust storm ! " what ' s the matter ? it ' s nothing , man . normally , it ' d be impossible to capture that fortress with just the five of us . however , if we manage to recover the last magatama , we will be able to save the lives of countless people now suffering in the capital . we ' re going to split up into two groups . tsuna and i will infiltrate the fortress . i ' m counting on the rest of you to divert the enemy ' s attention as best you can . hold on a minute . let me go with you this time . but why ? because i ' d like a turn at playing the hero for once ! here ! there ' s no stopping him . i ' ll be off , then . you three ! back me up , all right ? lord raikou ! lord tsuna ! you have your own job to do ! yes , that ' s right . .. let us launch our attack ! operation scarlet dust storm , begin ! here they come . .. but we shall give them measure for measure ! what the hell ' s going on ? i have no idea . it might be a trap . let ' s not let our guard down ! unbelievable firepower ! how many troops do they have inside the fortress ? kintaro ! are you all right ? i ' m fine ! come on , let ' s keep pounding them ! kintaro . .. here comes another one ! my name ' s usui no sadamitsu . are you shuten doji ? hey , hey , what the hell is that ? okay , so you ' re no gentleman ! they ' ve stopped their attack . what does this mean ? what could have happened ? lord raikou ! where can it be ? who are you ? can ' t you tell by looking at us ? we ' re the women of the fortress ! allow me to identify myself . i am minamoto no raikou . i am a warrior from the capital . please , do not be frightened . we have come here to recover the magatama of fire . recover the magatama ? a likely story ! we know you ' re planning to kill us all and take over these lands ! no , you ' re wrong ! we came here for one reason , to take back the magatama and save the suffering people in the capital . we have no intention of killing you , none whatsoever . what do you know . .. we heard that the warriors from the capital were barbarians but there are some like you , too . .. please , i need you to tell me . .. what kind of place is this ? is this not the kumaso stronghold ? yes , this is the kumaso stronghold . but we are not members of the kumaso clan . even so , the kumasos have treated outsiders like us with kindness . it was here that i met my husband , and was blessed with my child . as a woman , i could not be happier living here . hey , pretty good . not many people could hold their own against me , even in the capital ! what , you ' re waiting for me ? all right , let ' s do it ! so there are no kumaso soldiers here ? the only soldier here is this girl ' s husband , ivan . ivan ? go on , explain it to him . ivan is a soldier who came here from another land . another land ? then that ' s where you got your gunpowder technology . .. that ' s right . that is something ivan taught us . but my husband is a modest , kind - hearted man . lord shuten favored him not just for his knowledge but for his personality as well . i do believe that my husband is happy here . but ivan is always looking towards the sea . i suppose he wants to return to his homeland . not exactly pretty , the way you fight ! i see . and where is lord shuten doji now ? that ' s the thing , he ' s gotten all crazy in the head , our lord shuten . we can ' t wait for him to go back to being his old self . we feel so bad for ivan , having to protect the fortress alone . .. alone , you say ? ivan ! ivan ! you ' re not hurt , are you ? you ' re safe , aren ' t you ? sadamitsu ! taisho ! what ' s going on here ? this man ' s name is ivan . i was told he came here from another land . you mean , you ' re married to this guy ? yes . ivan only wanted to protect the place everyone will be coming home to . everyone ? shuten doji is on his way to the capital . he has gone to burn heian - kyo to the ground . is that true ? and what about the magatama ? shuten doji has taken it with him . let ' s leave this place together . i know lord shuten will forgive us . i will follow you wherever you go . even if it ' s beyond the sea . .. no , you ' re wrong there . your husband ' s homeland is here now . it ' s chinzei , because you and the baby are here . my homeland ! i sure wish i could be in your shoes ! having a woman who loves you so much . .. i mean , i hardly ever think about my homeland but i guess i ' m starting to appreciate having one now . i feel like going back to suzaku - ln to see the hydrangeas like i used to ! taisho ! no time to be bummed right now . let ' s hurry back to the capital . to our own homeland ! right . how dare he attack the capital ! no time to lose ! we ' re going back to the capital ! the capital is in peril . shuten doji and his troops are now within striking distance of heian - kyo . hikaru and her companions race desperately back to the capital now on the brink of destruction . . .. now on the brink of destruction . to be continued . .. to be continued . .. outside the window , the rain is falling , shutting us in . if you feel bad about today , then come pick me up . that ' s what i want to say , but i can ' t . .. the dreams that i wished upon a star are all coming true , one by one . yet i just can ' t seem to catch up with you . the dreams that i wished upon a star are all coming true , so . .. i want to get closer to you . a young warrior , minamoto no raikou , returns to the capital with a magatama . perhaps the suffering of the people of heian - kyo will be over soon . that mournful and elegant melody coming from her flute . .. could it be that she ' s calling to me ? as soon as this battle is over for good , then i shall . .. act nine , darkness . don ' t miss it !
otogi zoshi traveler , you must not look back wander on where the wind takes you the steps you take will guide you on your way journey on into the unknown there ' s a voice you cannot forget though it may bring you to tears you must live with all your might just think of your homeland and all your grief will vanish and all your grief will vanish throw old notions by the wayside go , go , until you ' ve slashed through the sunset look up toward those distant memories go , go , until you ' ve smashed through the sunset it is the heian period in japan . learning that the kumaso troops led by shuten doji are on their way to destroy the capital . .. hikaru and her companions have returned in haste to heian - kyo bearing the magatama of water . act nine darkness so far we haven ' t seen hide nor hair of shuten doji . .. are you lord minamoto no raikou ? what ? is that lord raikou ? has he returned with the magatama ? we beg of you , lord raikou , please save us ! lord raikou ! all right , all right ! let us get by , will you ? everyone looks so hungry . .. the capital looks even more ravaged than before we left . we must find the last remaining magatama of fire as soon as possible . .. but where is shuten doji , who took the magatama with him ? he ' s around here . i know he ' s just biding his time , waiting for the right moment to attack ! we traveled to the kumaso stronghold in chinzei but shuten doji had already left for the capital with his troops . the stronghold was completely empty . the magatama of fire is still in his possession . he ' s advancing on the capital ? you speak nonsense to cover up your failure to bring back the magatama ! no , i speak the truth ! shuten doji ' s army of 1,000 men is waiting for a chance to pounce on the capital . i implore you not to delay in bolstering the capital ' s defenses ! do you really believe it ' s possible to bring down the capital with a mere 1,000 men ? we have a force of 20,000 here ! yes , but shuten will be using a strange new technology called gunpowder from china ! seimei , what do you think ? moreover , as lord raikou appears to be weary from his hasty return from chinzei , i believe some rest will do him good . well ! what a fine idea . a coward such as raikou should just skulk in the back of his house ! raikou , you are dismissed ! consider yourself under house arrest until this matter is resolved ! that ' s right , you are hereby confined ! now , as for the festival for the return of all five magatamas , what do say shall we have a dashi drawn through the streets ? now that is a splendid idea indeed ! what ? confined ? is that what the minister of the left decreed ? yes , on the advice of abe no seimei . .. that damned white fox ! lord seimei is an onmyoji of the highest virtue . i am sure he only spoke out of concern for lord raikou ' s health . .. the only explanation i can think of is that he ' s planning to take credit himself for the last magatama ! he has the implicit trust of the emperor , and he is the head of the onmyo - ryo . what could he possibly want ? all i know is that one cannot trust the onmyojis ! okay , kids , that ' s enough ! it ' s depressing enough around here . let ' s not have any infighting here . right , taisho ? we must try to figure out what we can do now to save the capital . maybe we should just storm shuten doji ' s base camp ! but we don ' t even know where shuten is ! ever since we returned to the capital , we haven ' t seen any sign of his troops . all we ' ve seen around here are the traveling performers who ' ve come for the emperor ' s ascension ceremony and those mountain priests who burn the goma for incantations . .. goma ? you mean we get to eat sesame dumplings ? not that kind of goma ! oh , it ' s not ? man ! you mean the prayer for the next emperor ' s long and peaceful reign ? where are they doing it ? from what i ' ve heard in the capital , it ' s gonna be at ooeyama . ooeyama ? but the main temple in this area is kinpusen in yoshino . the capital lies to the southwest of ooeyama , in other words it ' s the demon ' s back gate . why would they choose to perform the rite from a direction normally shunned ? sounds fishy to me . .. now that i think of it , the women being sent to shuten weren ' t just from hitachi . i ' ll bet the kumasos weren ' t the only ones in league with him ! the magatamas were in the possession of five different tribes in each region . in each case , there was one person controlling that region . it wouldn ' t be farfetched to assume that the rest of them had ties to shuten doji . the kumaso troops number 1,000 . add that to the regional tribes . there ' s no telling how many we ' ll be up against . even with 5,000 soldiers protecting the capital gates . .. this is really bad news ! lord raikou ! i ' m going to ooeyama ! hey , hold on ! i ' m going to ooeyama to find out if shuten is there . if i can provide him with proof , i ' m sure the emperor will take action ! but wait ! lord raikou , remember that you are under confinement ! in that case , i shall return to the onmyo - ryo and ask lord seimei to lift the sentence of confinement . but you can ' t go there ! no need for concern . i am certain that lord seimei will understand . still , if shuten doji has his base camp on ooeyama mountain we won ' t be able to just bust in there without a strategy . i have a plan that should work . .. if you wish to hide in a forest , be a tree , to hide in the mountains , be a rock . lord raikou , i , tsuna , have a favor to ask of you . lord raikou , i am asking you to consider staying behind here ! what ? it is our job as your retainers to investigate ooeyama . there is no reason for you to violate your sentence of confinement ! tsuna ! how can l , minamoto no raikou , send only my retainers to enemy territory while i cower in the safety of my home ? lord raikou no , i mean lady hikaru ! you are first and foremost lady hikaru , not lord raikou ! do not throw away your chance for happiness as a woman . .. tsuna ! i implore you . .. don ' t say another word ! my resolve will crumble ! please , leave me alone now . my brother . .. i am so . .. are you going to the onmyo - ryo ? yes . in that case , i shall escort you . i must get onikirimaru honed immediately and since the onmyo - ryo is on my way . .. at first , i thought you were a court spy sent to watch over our actions during our journey . .. but apparently those were just groundless fears . i do not blame you for seeing me in that light . .. at the time , all i could think of was taking the magatamas by any means . but i have come to think only of how i can keep you all safe . that is the only thing on my mind now . both you and lord raikou are very dear to my heart ! i , too ? yes , you and lord sadamitsu and kintaro , i value you all as my friends . yes , i see . lord tsuna , you can ' t be . .. don ' t say anything ! it happens from time to time , that ' s all . lord tsuna ! just don ' t say anything to lord raikou . please . beautiful clouds spread long and thick . .. and an occasional sunbeam can be seen . .. through the bamboo blinds i see the red plums blooming everywhere . next year , when these flowers bloom again , who will be here to see them ? my elderly father ' s garden shall be ravaged by the wind and the rain . my brother , please tell me . .. is what you describe in this poem truly going to come to pass ? ah , there you are ! father ! raikou . .. no , i mean hikaru . .. it was i who sent you on these journeys in your brother ' s place . but losing you would be far more terrible than tarnishing our family name . no more journeys , i want you to stay here . but there ' s only one more left to go , the magatama of fire ! all i wish for is to see you happily married , no more . actually , i ' ve summoned a woman to help you with bridal preparations . i ' ll bring her here right away . father , i do not . .. listen , hikaru . .. i do not want to lose anyone , ever again . your brother raikou deserves to be properly buried . now then , hikaru , come with me . lord seimei , may i ask you to intervene on lord minamoto no raikou ' s behalf to have his confinement lifted ? the kumaso clan led by shuten doji has taken up a position they will lay siege until the capital falls ! urabe , how would you read this ? do you mean the magatamas ? the principles of onmyo gogyo . .. wood begets fire , fire begets earth , earth begets metal metal begets water , water begets wood in other words , the five elements in balance . to save the capital , there remains only one , the magatama of fire . .. where do you draw the line between good and evil ? above all , your true intentions must be strong and fearsome . .. the melody from your flute was like a sorrowful voice , longing to see me . mansairaku , i . .. if only this moment would last forever . .. if only someday i could dance just for you . .. mansairaku , i ' m so glad i met you . and i you . your flute eased the pain in my heart . you dance the grief of the people , you dance to venerate the dead . people have fought and destroyed themselves over a single magatama . i no longer understand the purpose of my journey . but once i get this journey behind me , then i know that i will find the answer and then , i want to . .. i , too , want to be with you . .. but we can ' t now . .. have you been standing there all along ? lady hikaru , what is this ? it ' s the poem my brother left for me . but look at this ! " to hide in a forest , become a tree , " huh ? what a great idea ! urabe ' s a real genius , isn ' t she ? yeah , it would be a good thing if you tried to be more like her ! it ' s that woman ! over there ! sorry to keep you waiting . the kid wouldn ' t leave until i made him some lunch to take along . rice balls , rice balls ! sadamitsu . .. that is a poem left to lord raikou by someone he trusted implicitly . .. it was written on his deathbed . it ' s hard to make out since the words are all smudged . can you read them now ? " seimei has a hidden agenda ! " do you think he ' s in league with the kumasos ? the kumaso troops advanced , and positioned themselves on ooeyama to attack on the day of the new emperor ' s ascension . .. it ' s much too well - organized ! but if he has an informer within the capital , then it all makes sense . abe no seimei is pulling the strings . .. huh ? lady urabe hasn ' t shown up yet . .. she can ' t be . .. urabe will come ! she values us all as her friends . .. that ' s what she told me . ibaraki . .. lord shuten , it is not yet the appointed time . do it ! burn the damned capital to the ground ! what ' s going on ? what in the world is happening ? so the demon could not wait , eh ? it is a desperate life - or - death struggle with shuten doji that awaits hikaru and her companions as they head for ooeyama . to be continued . .. outside the window , the rain is falling , shutting us in . if you feel bad about today , then come pick me up . that ' s what i want to say , but i can ' t . .. the dreams that i wished upon a star are all coming true , one by one . yet i just can ' t seem to catch up with you . the dreams that i wished upon a star are all coming true , so . .. i want to get closer to you . so i guess we ' re headed for a showdown with that shuten doji , huh ? can ' t wait to put my sword to the test ! i mean , it ' s up to us to protect heian - kyo . you ' re acting kind of strange , t aisho . i ' ll bet that shuten doji has something up his sleeve . and it ' s really bugging me that lady urabe hasn ' t come back yet . .. maybe something ' s happened to her ? act 1 0 : shuten don ' t miss it !
freud . thanks to your miracle technique , i am no longer delusional . it ' s called hypnosis , fraulein . i took you back to re - experience your childhood . whatever you did , it worked . i used to think that little men were following me around , but now i know that little men were just in meine imagination . ach . excuse me , fraulein . you stand lookout while i write my name in dr . freud ' s appointment book . right , brain . hello . lovely day , isn ' t it ?

well , actually , i was thinking of it more as entertainment . poit . all vienna knows that the emperor franz josef is being treated by freud for depression . when freud is under my spell . .. unh ! i will order him to hypnotize the emperor into giving me , the brain , his right to the imperial throne , allowing me to take over the world ! uhh ! ooh ! did you bring my mirrored glasses , pinky ? yes , i did , brain . they ' re right in here with all the fun , fun games i brought to play with in the waiting room . zort ! oh , look . i ' ve got jacks and wind - up toys and a mahjong tile and a bottle cap - - ooh ! and yarn . freud : herr brain , you ' re next . no ! don ' t leave me ! i ' ll be so bored ! what shall i do ?

excuse me ? i ' m sorry . i ' m just trying to make small talk . ach , don ' t trouble yourself . i ' m just a sad little sad man . life brings me nothing but dreary sadness . i ' m sad all the time . boy , am i sad . well , i brought a pair of googly - eye glasses . they ' ll cheer you up . oogedy - boogedy ! ha ha ha ha ha ! narf ! but all i see is my own dreary , sad little sad face . poit . these aren ' t my googly - eye glasses . these are mirrored gla - - uh - oh . you are getting sleepy . .. very sleepy . no , no . you are getting sleepy . hey , take off those ridiculous glasses . huh ?

ja . i mean . .. yes . i want you to think about a time when you were very young . where you are , brain ? brain : in a field , playing . how old are you ? just a child , not a care in the world . suddenly i ' m being chased , hunted down like some sort of rabid dog . terrified , i run home to my parents . they rush to my aid , but my assailant is overpowering . i was taken from my home and sent to a research facility . as i entered those doors , the carefree innocence of my youth was snuffed out like a candle , replaced with unremitting darkness . lab - coated goons tried to break our spirits and brainwash us into submission . others emerged from the experience . .. not quite all there . narf ! zort ! hee hee hee hee ! the slightest insolence resulted in punishment both swift and brutal . please , sir , i ' d like some more . more ? you want more ? aah . aah ! i never met a man i didn ' t meet . aah ! the problem with congress is . .. they ' re all liars . aah ! make it stop ! and how did that make you feel ? angry . .. like i wanted to . .. to take over the world . hmm . emotional displacement . obviously , you were missing the comfort of your home . describe the scene when you were taken away . describe your home . brain : it ' s warm . it ' s inviting . it ' s . .. a tin can . there ' s something on the side of it , a . .. a picture . freud : a picture of what ? no . no . i - -i mean , i - -i can ' t tell . yes . you must . it ' s a picture of . .. of . .. the world ! and then they dragged me away . and you want your world back . it ' s simple . yes . what ? where am i ? your problem is simple , herr brain . you just want to go home . i do ? ja . you don ' t want to take over the world . i don ' t ? i don ' t ? ok , time ' s up . wait . my plan . i - -i need more time . ja . ja . we set up another appointment . no , i - i ' ve got to . .. " how to hypnotize anyone . create a relaxing atmosphere . " okey - dokey , you sick little puppy . move it . i got another client . oh , there ' s not enough time for this . oh ! oh , no . what have i done ? oh , no . what have i done ? yes ! you ' ll obey my every command . i will obey . but wait . maybe freud is right . maybe this obsession of mine is nothing but cheap nostalgia . assuming a standard height - to - weight ratio and a 3 - point margin of error . .. pinky : ha ha ha ha ! factor in g - force and wind shear of each downward thrust . .. ha ha ha ha ! that does it ! pinky , what are you doing ? ha ha ha ! oh , poit ! i ' m playing with my new " tickle me herbert " doll , brain . you just tickle him here , and he laughs and laughs . kootchie kootchie kootchie ! well , put it away . i can hardly hear myself think . maybe you ' re just not thinking loud enough , brain . pinky , may i see that for a moment ? sure - -uhh ! oh , brain , i think he likes you . zort ! now maybe i ' ll have the quiet i need to finish perfecting my latest plan . you might say we ' re going fishing . fishing ? troz ! oh , what fun , brain ! i ' ll bring my beekeeper ' s bonnet and all the stuff you need for keeping bees . oh , no , no , wait . that ' s not fishing . ha ! oh , that ' s skiing . try to focus , pinky . this is the finnious japonicus , commonly known in japan as mugu . one bite of its tail renders anyone who eats it unable to move for 24 hours . i had a linoleum sandwich last week that made me feel the same way , but shiny . pinky , if you have anything to say , please raise your hand . right , brain . and place it over your mouth . ok . my plan is simply this - - i will capture a pair of mugu , breed them , and market the tails throughout the world as cappy brain ' s frozen fish sticks . while the populace is immobilized , i shall implement my plan of world domination . there ' s only one catch . oh ? well , that won ' t be enough to feed the whole world , then , will it ? sorry . the japonicus is so rare that the only known specimens are those bred in captivity for the dining pleasure of japan ' s most elite sumo wrestlers . take your hand off your mouth if you ' re going to speak , pinky . oh . i have anticipated your query , pinky . i plan to become one of japan ' s most elite sumo wrestlers . observe . narf ! the " tickle me dom deluise " ? oh , why , that ' s the most expensive one . look closer , pinky . i have modified my suit to fit the precise specifications of a champion sumo wrestler . with the adjustments i ' ve made , i ' ll be able to flip a 600 - pound man . won ' t you need an awfully large spatula for that ? don ' t forget to pack your doll when we go to japan , pinky . i might feel the need for some intelligent conversation . noogie . give him the noogie . noogie , noogie , noogie . unh ! good work , tomu - san . tomorrow we work on the wedgie . now go . brain : master hama ? yes ? allow me to introduce myself . i am the brain . i have come many miles with my small valet pinky to study sumo at the camp of master hama . your head is as small as a lychee nut , but your physique is excellent for sumo . i would be honored to teach you . actually , i am but an insignificant lab mouse attempting to take over the world . the honor is all mine . whaa ! whoa ! there is no need for false humility and groveling . come . we begin immediately . let us begin our first lesson . excellent . who do i flip first ? patience , brain - san . there will be time for flipping when you are more advanced . today , we consider the pebble . consider the pebble ? zen exercise to increase concentration . observe the pebble ' s simplicity . listen to its silence . become the pebble . you want me to stare at a rock all day ? oh , no , no . just until lunchtime . see you in 4 hours . hama thinks i ' m a beginner , pinky . until he lets me compete and prove that i belong in the camp with advanced wrestlers , i ' ll never get access to the mugu . pinky ? what ? oh , sorry , brain . i was becoming one with the pebble . were you ? yes . and it ' s really easy . all you have to do is make your mind a complete blank . too bad drawing a blank isn ' t an olympic event , pinky . we could retire on the gold medals you ' d win . eat well , brain - san . we have much training left to do . aren ' t you hungry , master hama ? no . i eat big lunch with my star wrestlers in other dining hall - - fried mugu , cajun mugu , mugu chowder , mojo mugu . someday , brain - san , perhaps you will be allowed to eat mugu , too , eh ? sooner than you think , my pan - pacific friend . the sumo men must eat a lot to get so fat . wrestlers not fat , pinky - san . it is muscle tissue resulting from years of strenuous yoga exercises . who wants pie ? well , even the best athletes like a good meringue . pinky , a day has passed , and we have nothing to show for it . oh , i don ' t know , brain . i ' ve developed a lovely relationship with our new friend the pebble . pinky , have you ever contemplated the sound of one hand bopping ? one hand , um . .. don ' t think so . aah ! what is it ? what ' s going on ? it is matsuhisa , the best wrestler in camp . he has had too much pie and is taking on all challengers . grrr ! pinky : egad , brain . you ' d have to be quite a wrestler to beat that matsu hoozy fellow . pinky , are you pondering what i ' m pondering ? i think so , brain , but who wants to see snow white and the seven samurai ? no , pinky . i will defeat the great matsuhisa , thereby proving that i am a great sumo wrestler . then you can eat pie till you pop . narf ! aah ! matsuhisa , i will accept your challenge . what ' s going on here ? brain - san has gone completely insane . hmm , oh , that would explain why he won ' t talk to my new friend the pebble .
